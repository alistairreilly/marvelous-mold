### Marvelous Mold

#### Purpose

The **purpose** of this experiment was to see if certain foods  mold faster than other foods, and if the environment had an any impact on how fast the mold grows.

#### Hypothesis

The **hypothesis** of this experiment was that:

* mold would grow slowest when food is in the fridge
* mold would look different on each food item
* the orange and the cheese would mold first

#### Materials

The **materials** needed are as follows:

* 1 slice of bread
* 1 orange
* 1 block of cheese
* 15 sandwich bags
* 1 sharp knife
* 1 chopping board
* 1 science log book
* 1 black marker pen

#### Procedure

The **procedure** is as follows:

1. cut the bread into 5 equal pieces
2. cut the cheese into 5 equal pieces
3. cut the orange into 5 equal pieces
4. put each food item in a separate sandwich bag and label it with the black marker
5. put each set of 3 food items in a different environment
6. check each item every day and record your observations

#### Data

The **data** is recorded in CSV format [here](log.csv)

| **Bathroom** | **Cheese** |0|0|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|3|3|4|

#### Conclusion

The **conclusion** is as follows:

* different foods grow at different speeds
 * mold grows slow in the dark and cold
 * mold grows fast in the heat and light
* mold comes in all sorts of shapes and colors
 * mold starts off white on cheese
 * mold starts of black on orange
* daddy’s bread doesn’t mold

#### Acknowledgements

* Thank you mommy for letting me use your bread, cheese and organges
* Thank you daddy for helping me with the computer
